- Set status to "passed" ONLY if absolutely NO violations detected
- Always err on the side of caution - FALSE POSITIVES are better than missed violations
- Be extremely thorough in analyzing both image content AND caption text
- Any detected violation should result in IMMEDIATE blocking
- Provide detailed blocking reasons for transparency`;
